$$s = k^{-1}(e + r \cdot d_A) \pmod{n}$$Where:$s$ is the signature you broadcast to the network.$k$ is a random integer (nonce) used for the transaction.$e$ is the hash of the transaction you want to send.$r$ is the x-coordinate of a point on the curve derived from $k$.$d_A$ is the Private Key (the secret variable).$n$ is the order of the curve.
